### Tools for Virus

#### PhaGenus (2023) &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/24/6/bbad408/7420494?login=true#425616568"> <u>Paper</u> </a>  &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/jiaojiaoguan/phagenus"> <u>Code</u> </a>
PhaGenus is a learning-based model that conducts genus-level taxonomic classification for phage contigs. It utilizes a powerful transformer model to learn the association between protein clusters and support the classification of up to 508 genera. 


#### ViralM (2024) &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/ChengPENG-wolf/ViraLM"> Code </a>
A Viral Language Model for virus identification from metagenomic data. 

#### VirBot (2023) &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad093"> <u>Paper</u> </a>  &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/GreyGuoweiChen/VirBot"> <u>Code</u> </a>
VirBot is an easy-to-use yet effective tool to identify RNA virus from metagenomic data. It leverages a comprehensive collection of RNA viral profile hidden markov models (pHMMs), enabling the detection of conserved sequences despite the high mutation rates of RNA viruses. Besides the accurate identification, VirBot also provides taxonmic label of the detected RNA viruses.
