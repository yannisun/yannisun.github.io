### Ph.D. students, Research Assistant (RA), and Postdoc or senior RA openings

Group: Dr. Yanni Sun, Electrical Engineering at City University of Hong Kong 

When the human genome was sequenced more than a decade ago, people thought that we obtained the language of life. However, it turns out that this is not a language we understand! Our research goal is to apply computational models/methods to decypher the language of life. The methods/tools we use include: advanced data structures, general algorithm design, machine learning methods, applied deep learning, data mining techniques, graph theories etc. You will be trained to handle BIG genomic data and solve high-impact research problems. The training will provide you with ample career opportunities.

### Research area and projects: 

- Bioinformatics: sequence analysis, plant genome annotation
- Deep learning-based virus composition analysis, virus host prediction, and virus classification. 
- Metagenomic analysis: strain-level composition
- Viral haplotype reconstruction using third-generation sequencing (TGS) reads
- Accurate virus genome assembly using nanopore reads

We have on-going research projects on RNA viruses, phages, bacterial strain analysis in metagenomic data, plant genomics, etc. You can refer to the following publications for further details.

The methods/tools we use include: general algorithm design, machine learning methods, applied deep learning, data mining techniques, graph theories etc. You will be trained to handle BIG genomic data and solve high-impact research problems. 

### My expectations:
- You should have training from Computer Science, Data Science, Electronic Engineering, BME, Bioinformatics, Statistics, or related fields
- You need to be familiar with some programming languages/data processing pipelines. I also welcome applicants with research experiences in microbiology even though you have limited experiences in programming 
- You should be highly motivated to study research problems you are interested in. I am happy to provide you with the freedom of choosing appropriate research topics. 
- If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a message (yannisun@cityu.edu.hk).
