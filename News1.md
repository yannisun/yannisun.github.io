      <h2>Congratulations! Caifang and Jiaojiao's work on dissecting the gut microbial communities and resistomes of wild rats from different ecological areas in Hong Kong was published in Environmental Research!</h2>
       <p><b>June 7, 2025</b></p>
      <p> Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the top global public health issues shared across all One Health domains. We trapped 88 live rats, belonging to the species of Rattus norvegicus (n=57), R. tanezumi (n=24), and R. andamanensis (n=7), from city regions, livestock farms, and stables of horse-riding schools (referred to as “suburbs”). We identified 9672 ARGs belonging to 29 ARG types and 554 ARG subtypes. Among them, aminoglycosides, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin and chloramphenicol, known to be predominant in livestock gut resistome or manure compost were significantly more abundant in rats from livestock farms. Moreover, some ARGs with high-risk levels, including tetM, tetL, floR, mecR1 and lnuA, as well as plasmid-borne ARGs were significantly more abundant in rats from livestock farms than from city regions or suburbs. Furthermore, zoonotic antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) were detected, including but not limited to, prioritized antimicrobial-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Acinetobacter baumannii, Campylobacter jejuni, and Staphylococcus aureus. Notably, resistant zoonotic bacteria of Streptococcus suis, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter jejuni were more abundant in wild rats from livestock farms. Our findings provides insights into the gut resistomes and zoonotic bacteria in wild rats in Hong Kong, highlighting the potential role of wild rats in the dissemination of ARGs and zoonotic pathogens, especially for those from agricultural settings.</p>

      <h2>Congratulations! Fuchang and jiayu’s work on NCLDV identification from metagenomic data was accepted by ISMB/ECCB 2025</h2>
       <p><b>Apr. 7, 2025</b></p>
      <p> Nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) are notable for their large genomes and extensive gene repertoires. However, identifying NCLDV sequences in metagenomic data remains challenging due to their high genomic diversity, limited reference genomes, and shared regions with other microbes. Existing alignment-based and machine learning methods struggle with achieving optimal trade-offs between sensitivity and precision. In this work, we present GiantHunter, a reinforcement learning-based tool for identifying NCLDVs from metagenomic data. By employing a Monte Carlo tree search strategy, GiantHunter dynamically selects representative non-NCLDV sequences as the negative training data, enabling the model to establish a robust decision boundary. Benchmarking on rigorously designed experiments shows that GiantHunter achieves high precision while maintaining competitive sensitivity, improving the F1-score by 10% and reducing computational cost by 90% compared to the second-best method.</p>

      <h2>Congratulations! Wei’s work on plasmid multiple host range prediction was published by Bioinformatics </h2>
       <p><b>Feb. 25, 2025</b></p>
      <p>We present a new plasmid host range prediction tool called MOSTPLAS. To the best of our knowledge, MOSTPLAS is the first attempt to implement a multi-label learning model to recognize all the possible host genera of input plasmid sequences. To mitigate the limitation of lacking databases with complete annotations of broad-host-range plasmids for the training of learning models, we design a plasmid-encoded protein-based pseudo-label generation algorithm and a self-correction asymmetric loss in MOSTPLAS. On the multi-host RefSeq plasmid test set, when all the tools achieved a precision higher than 80%, the recall and F1-score of MOSTPLAS improved by 5.7% and 5.0%, comparing with the second-best tool. In the same time, MOSTPLAS saved about 90% running time compared to BLAST (alignment-based tool) and 80% running time comparing to HOTSPOT (learning-based tool). These results demonstrate the effectiveness and high computation efficiency of MOSTPLAS.

       <p><b>Nov. 27th, 2024</b></p>
      <p>In this study, we introduce PlasGO, a tool that leverages a hierarchical architecture to predict GO terms for plasmid proteins. PlasGO utilizes a powerful protein language model to learn the local context within protein sentences and a BERT model to capture the global context within plasmid sentences. Additionally, PlasGO allows users to control the precision by incorporating a self-attention confidence weighting mechanism. The experimental results collectively demonstrate that PlasGO has achieved commendable performance. PlasGO significantly expanded the annotations of the plasmid-encoded protein database by assigning high-confidence GO terms to over 95% of previously unannotated proteins, showcasing impressive precision of 0.8229, 0.7941, and 0.8870 for the 3 GO categories, respectively, as measured on the novel protein test set.

       <p><b>Sep. 22, 2024</b></p>
      <p>We present a novel protein embedding method using multi-teacher distillation learning to address the computational challenges in protein analysis. Traditional protein embedding methods, while effective for tasks like gene ontology and protein structure prediction, often require massive computational resources with millions to billions of parameters. Our approach leverages knowledge from multiple pre-trained protein embedding models to create efficient protein representations. The method demonstrates significant efficiency improvements, reducing computational time by approximately 70% while maintaining accuracy within ±1.5% of state-of-the-art models. This advancement enables more efficient large-scale protein analysis in bioinformatics research.</p>

      <p>We present VirTAXA, a robust classification tool that combines remote homology search and tree-based validation to enhance the genus-level taxonomic classification of RNA viruses. VirTAXA can predict the genus label of an assembled viral contig and provide evidence type for each prediction. It achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods while assigning genus labels to a greater number of sequences. Specifically, on the Global Ocean RNA metatranscriptomic data, VirTAXA can assign genus labels for over 10% more contigs than other classification tools. Furthermore, we demonstrated that VirTAXA can be conveniently extended to other types of viruses. VirTAXA takes contigs as input, assigns the genus label, and provides the associated evidence. It can also predict new genera using the phylogenetic tree analysis.

       <p><b>April 11, 2024</b></p>
      <p>This work developed a novel tool called SourceID-NMF for more precise microbial source tracking. SourceID-NMF utilizes a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm to trace the microbial sources contributing to a target sample. By leveraging the taxa abundance in both available sources and the target sample, SourceID-NMF estimates the proportion of available sources present in the target sample. A series of benchmarking experiments using simulated and real data were conducted to evaluate the performance of SourceID-NMF. The simulated experiments aimed to mimic realistic yet challenging scenarios, including identifying highly similar sources, irrelevant sources, unknown sources, low abundance sources, and noise sources. The results demonstrate the superior accuracy of SourceID-NMF compared to existing methods. In particular, SourceID-NMF accurately estimated the proportion of irrelevant and unknown sources, while other tools tended to either over- or under-estimate them. Additionally, the noise sources experiment showcased the robustness of SourceID-NMF for microbial source tracking.

      <h2>Congratulations! Herui and Runzhou Successfully Defend Their Dissertations!</h2>
      <p>The thesis title of Herui is "Computational Methods for high-resolution microbial composition analysis and relevant applications". 
In this thesis, we developed a viral strain identification tool VirStrain, a bacterial strain identification tool StrainScan, and a microbial-based host disease classification method GDmicro. We applied these tools to large-scale real sequencing samples, including pathogen-infected patients, individuals from different countries, colorectal cancer cohorts, etc. The experimental results demonstrate these tools have the potential to enhance our comprehension of microbes and facilitate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for diseases.

Runzhou's thesis title is "Computational Methods for accurate reconstruction of RNA viral genomes using third-generation sequencing data".
This thesis presents three main works. The first work introduces AccuVIR, a tool for accurate viral genome assembly and polishing by generating high-quality paths in alignment graphs and then ranking them using multiple criteria. It performs well with both known and novel viruses, as demonstrated through evaluations with simulated and real sequencing data. The second work is HMMPolish, a pipeline designed to refine protein-coding regions of known RNA viruses sequenced using third-generation sequencing. HMMPolish utilizes profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) of viral proteins and has been validated with clinically important virus datasets. The third work reviews commonly used profile HMM databases for viral metagenomic data. It evaluates their model properties using quantitative metrics and assesses their performance with simulated and real metagenomic datasets. The findings provide practical suggestions for optimizing the use of these databases in viral metagenomics research.

      <p>With advances in metagenomic sequencing technologies, there are accumulating studies revealing the associations between the human gut microbiome and some human diseases. These associations shed light on using gut microbiome data to distinguish case and control samples of a specific disease, which is also called host disease status classification. However, available tools have not fully addressed two challenges associated with this task: limited labeled microbiome data and decreased accuracy in cross-studies. To address these challenges, we develop a new tool GDmicro, which combines semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation to achieve a more generalized model using limited labeled samples.

      <p><b>Nov. 10, 2023</b></p>
      <p>As important mobile genetic elements, phages support the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Previous analyses of metaviromes or metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) failed to assess the extent of ARGs transferred by phages, particularly in the generation of antibiotic pathogens. Therefore, we have developed a bioinformatic pipeline that utilizes deep learning techniques to identify ARG-carrying phages and predict their hosts, with a special focus on pathogens. Using this method, we discovered that the predominant types of ARGs carried by temperate phages in a typical landscape lake, which is fully replenished by reclaimed water, were related to multidrug resistance and β-lactam antibiotics.

The alignment component in PLASMe facilitates the easy identification of closely related plasmids, while order-specific Transformer models predict diverged plasmids with accuracy. 
      The tool is available at <a href="https://github.com/HubertTang/PLASMe">PLASMe.</a> Check out the paper at <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkad578/7222081">PLASMe: a tool to identify PLASMid contigs from short-read assemblies using transformer</a></p>

      <p> In this work, we construct a tool named HOTSPOT, aiming at predicting the host association of plasmids. By incorporating the state-of-the-art language model, Transformer, in each node’s taxon classifier, the top-down tree search achieves an accurate host taxonomy prediction for the input plasmid contigs. We rigorously tested HOTSPOT on multiple datasets and all experiments show that HOTSPOT outperforms other popular methods.

      <p> In this work, we described a tool, VirBot, aiming at identifying the RNA virus contig from the metagenomic data. Based on the profile hidden Markov model (pHMM), VirBot can better detect novel RNA virus sequences which share little similarity with the known species while maintaining high precision. In the benchmark experiment on both simulated and real sequencing data, VirBot shows its high specificity in metagenomic datasets and superior sensitivity in detecting novel RNA viruses.

      <h2> A new integrated software named PhaBOX for phage identification and analysis has been developed! </h2>
      <p><b>Jan. 3rd, 2023</b></p>
      <p> Bacteriophages (phages) play key roles in regulating the composition/function of the microbiome by infecting their host bacteria. Lacking integrated software for phage identification and analysis, novel phages awaiting to be discovered constitute a large portion of “viral dark matter”. In this work, we developed a web server, named PhaBOX, to accurately identify and analyze phage contigs in metagenomic data. To our best knowledge, this is the first web server for comprehensive phage contig analysis in metagenomic data. PhaBOX integrates our previously published tools: PhaMer, PhaTYP, PhaGCN, and CHERRY, for phage identification, lifestyle prediction, taxonomy classification, and host prediction, respectively. To help users conduct downstream analysis, PhaBOX also provides visualization of the essential features for making the predictions, such as the similarity-based relationships between the contigs and other phages, predicted proteins on the contigs, and protein homology. All the predictions and intermediate results are provided for users. We hope that it can help advance the field of phage study in various ecosystems.

      <p><b>Dec. 26th, 2022</b></p>
      <p>In this work, we introduce a new tool, AccuVIR, for viral genome assembly and polishing using error-prone long reads. It can better distinguish sequencing errors from true variants based on the key observation that sequencing errors can disrupt the gene structures of viruses, which usually have high density of coding regions. Our experimental results on both simulated and real third-generation sequencing data demonstrated its superior performance on generating more accurate viral genomes than generic assembly or polish tools. The tool is available at https://github.com/rainyrubyzhou/AccuVIR. Check out the paper at https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac827</p>

      <p> This work developed a tool “HaploDMF” to reconstruct viral haplotypes from TGS data. Unlike existing tools that reconstruct haplotypes by checking the identity of overlap between reads, HaploDMF utilizes a deep matrix factorization model with an adapted loss function to automatically learn latent features from aligned reads. It is able to achieve highly robust performance on data with different properties while existing tools’ performance can be affected by the overlap size between reads. The tool is available at https://github.com/dhcai21/HaploDMF.</p>

      <p> Bacteriophages (or phages), which infect bacteria, have two distinct lifestyles: virulent and temperate. Predicting the lifestyle of phages helps decipher their interactions with their bacterial hosts, aiding phages' applications in fields such as phage therapy. PhaTYP adopt Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) to learn the protein composition and associations from phage genomes and achieves more stable performance on short contigs.
